# DigitalBookAnalysis
In this java project, I wrote a program that reads in digital books in TXT format using Java, parses the books into single letters and words and stores them into a HashMap or Arraylist for further analysis. I analyzed the books to determine the top 10 most frequent letters, words, and longest/shortest quotations from the books.
